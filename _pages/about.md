Industrial experience
======


Head of Deep Learning R&D Group in IBM
(06/2018-present)
------
Lead deep learning research and engineering team in IBM.
My team has developed lots of advanced techniques and products for IBM Watson AI. Our mission includes designing new 
deep learning techniques and novel efficient product features to improve IBM Watson services and accelerate IBM technique transformation. The goal is to facilate our initernal and external business partners. Our another mission is to push the boundary of state-of-the-art AI techniques for IBM and the public deep learning community. Our research and products cover natual language understanding, computer vision, sensor signal understanding, medical and digitial health, etc. For more details, please keep track of our new patents and publications.



Research Manager & Senior Research Scientist in Samsung
(09/2015-06/2018)
------
Lead deep learning & computer vision research and engineering team at AI R&D center of SRA and built the whole deep learning and computer vision team from the beginning in limited time. My team has developed a set of advanced prototypes based on real-time deep learning inference on device technology with focusing on CV domain. 18 industrial patents and 12 academic papers have been submitted. These papers and patents cover deep model compression (CNN, LSTM and RNN) and acceleration on mobile devices, action classification, real-time facial image analysis (detection, verification and liveness detection), automatic speech recognition(ASR), natural language processing (NLP), real time lipreading on device, speak activity detection on device, dynamic video frames generation, semantic segmentation, deep learning mobile system design and image captioning.
One recent work: DeepRebirth: Accelerating Deep Neural Network Execution on Mobile Devices has been reported by several popular Medias including esestech.com, sohu.com, sina.com, ifeng.com, etc. (The only public reported research work of SRA from 2015.)


Research Intern in IBM Research
(05/2015-09/2015)
------
Worked in deep learning based facial image analysis and image retrieval in IBM Thomas J Watson Research Center, Yorktown Heights, NY. 


Research Assistant in University of Delaware
(09/2012-05/2015)
------
My research interest was to solve real-world perception problems. These problems include face image analysis (face recognition, gender classification, kinship verification and age estimation), attributes perception, object classification, object detection, social relationship prediction, human traits recognition, document categorization etc. I was also interested in using computational learning technologies for medical image analysis and bioinformatics, etc. Eleven first author papers were published during this period.
